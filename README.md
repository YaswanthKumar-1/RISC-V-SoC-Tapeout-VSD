# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

This repository documents my weekly progress in the SoC Tapeout Program by VSD.

The program teaches us to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII layout using open-source tools. This initiative is part of Indiaâ€™s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout, empowering over 3500 participants.
